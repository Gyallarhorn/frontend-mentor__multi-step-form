## Overview

### The challenge

Users are able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
    - A field has been missed
    - The email address is not formatted correctly
    - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made
- Fill in all fields using the keyboard
- In case of an incorrect address, see the error page and go back to the beginning
- In case of an accidental reboot, all entered data will be saved
- Send the entered data using EmailJS

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [EmailJS API](https://www.emailjs.com/)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Webpack
- I also used linters (stylelint and ESLint) to improve the quality of the code.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - First of all, the resource was very helpful at the configuration stage of the project build, because errors from the webpack side constantly occurred
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/) -  CSS property values, Grid, various functions, and more, all from there
- [EmailJS documentation](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/) -  it helped me figure out how to send data to the mail from the client
- [React Router documentation](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) -  Basic routing setup
- [Styled Components documentation](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics) -  Creating styled components, passing attributes, animations
- [Styled Components for beginners](https://dev.to/damkols/styled-components-for-beginners-23fg) -  The same
- [Global Styles](https://scalablecss.com/styled-components-global-styles/) -  creating global project styles
- [Fireworks](https://alvaromontoro.com/blog/68002/creating-a-firework-effect-with-css) -  firework effect:)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - When other resources didn't help...
